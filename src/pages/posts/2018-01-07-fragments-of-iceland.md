  Technical writing is a type of writing where the author is writing about a
  particular subject that requires direction, instruction, or explanation. This
  style of writing has a very different purpose and different characteristics

As a science student writing was one of my greatest challenges;  I know some people find themselves under this category. I, at first would convince myself that writing is not meant for everyone, especially those that are science and mathematically inclined but that changed with time as reality began to set in.

Take this from someone that disliked writing that writing, especially professionally, is one act that contributes to making one whole. To be well rounded in any profession, one must learn to write. Why? some may ask, but do not worry, we are going to look at the benefits of writing and how it can help a person grow in their respective profession. This article might often make references with writing as a software engineer or as a technologist, but the article is meant to showcase why writing in any profession is important, thus, it is profession agnostic.

## **Why should we write?**

Different reasons for different folks, right? But we are going to focus on a few benefits of writing professionally.Â 

To re-learn: Writing things down appear to help us remember the important stuff, and the better our notes are the more likely we are to remember. Just taking note helps make what we have learned stick, having to write about it is even better. While writing, one tends to revisit the topic learned, do even broader research on the topic, while trying to understand better the underlying principles in order to be able to explain them in their own terms. This process obliviously helps one memorize the thoughts and even better, one understands the necessary techniques or approaches to the case study. Its been shown that one hardly go wrong with the writing.

* To Share
* To attract
* To affirm
* To inspire

## What if I dislike writing?

Like I mentioned in the introductory part of this article, a couple of people or more might feel like they do not like writing or they do not know how to write. I must admit that to some, writing comes naturally, while others would have to make a conscious effort to write and I stand to be corrected. Having said this, you must agree with me that not everything we need to come to us naturally, some we have to go after. I will share some of my beliefs on how to start writing especially if you found yourself saying "I dislike writing".

## **How to cultivate a habit of writing.**

* Decide
* Begin
* Learn
* Grow
* Repeat

## **When should I write?**

The response to this might differ for different kinds of a profession and the list can be infinite; so I will be sharing a few, I believe, cut across many professions for a start and they include;

* When I want to learn something new.
* when I have learned something new.
* When I have an opinion about something.
* When I want to learn more about anything.
* When I want to make inquiries.
* When I disagree.
* When I want to buttress.

## Conclusion

It can see that not only does writing help us to share information we have with others, it also helps us to know more, help what we have learned stick, get what others think and also encourage others to learn. There is a saying that no one is an island of knowledge, so one cannot say they know it all. Not sharing one's idea can kill the idea or at least prevents the idea from reaching its maximum potential. I will end by saying this "You will never know that you do not know about something if you do not know of its existence".
